# joey: quote a random word in the style of Joey from friends.

## Motivation

This is "not" a frivolous "project."

## Running

Run as

./joey.py

or

python -u joey.py

The -u is important for interactive mode, as it unbuffers stdin and
stdout.

## Future Directions

There are "many" ways this could be made more "interesting."  None of
them will ever "happen."
